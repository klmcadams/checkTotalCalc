# GUI Total Check Calculation

This program was created in the IDLE environment for Python. The library used in the code is tkinter, the standard GUI library. After compiling and running the file, a window pops up where the user can enter the total cost of the check, the percent tax, and the percent tip. It then calculates the total for the check after adding tax and a tip.
